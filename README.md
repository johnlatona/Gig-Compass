# GigCompass

## Overview 

GigCompass is an event-search application that finds music, sports, or arts and theater type events within a specific location. It was designed with the frequent traveler in mind to be able to quickly locate events at their destination in order to more easily be able to experience the local music, arts, or sports scene where they are staying. 

The user can search using a keyword i.e. "Coldplay" or "NY Giants", or they can select a category, location (city, state, or zip) and dates and the application will pull all events occurring within those parameters from the ticketmaster API. Once a search is submitted, the app will display all events in a list-type fashion with a map of the location of all of the venues where the events are taking place using the Google Maps API. When an event result is clicked, a pop-up will appear containing more information regarding the event, along with a link to purchase tickets. The map will also rerender with a pin displaying the location of the specific venue for that event. The user can then click the map pin, and Google Maps will calculate directions to that event from their location.
